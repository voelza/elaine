# ELAINE Documentation

The frontend framework without a virtual DOM.

## Concepts
In this frontend framework everything is based around "states". States will be used to fill templates directly in the DOM and update them if they change. The main idea is to declare states on the JavaScript side and link them to DOM elements.

## Syntax
To link our states to a DOM element we have to call the `setup`function and give it the element which is our templated application. The template will be parsed and link states accordingly. To give states to the linker you have to declare the states insides an object like this:

```javascript
const counter = Elaine.state(0);
const increaseCounter = () => {
    counter.value++;
};
const immutableState = "This will never change";

Elaine.setup(document.getElementById("app"), {
    state: {
        counter, 
        increaseCounter,
        immutableStates
    }
});
```
States can be variables which where called by the `state(value)` method (as you can see with `counter`). If you don't wrap your states into the `state`function they will not be reactive and changes to them will not be deployed through links to the templated DOM elements. But if you need constant values which where determined in the script part of your program, you can still pass them to the linker like you would with reactive states. Also you can pass through methods which can be linked in the template for interactions (see `increaseCounter`).

The template portion of your application can be directly in the DOM itself.
```html
    <div id="app">
        <h1>@@{immutableState}</h1>
        @@{counter}
        <button ++click="increaseCounter">Count</button>
    </div>
```
By using the `@@{counter}` you can link the `counter` state to a text node in the DOM. With the `++click="increaseCounter"` attribute on the button element we linked our `increaseCounter` function to the DOM element. This is how the linking process in this framework works.

### State Declaration
To declare a reactive state you have call the `state` function.
```javascript
const counter = Elaine.state(0);
```
This function wraps the given value into a proxy which will update all the links to it from the template if that value changes. Because it works with a proxy you cannot change the state directly but you have to use `state.value` instead.

```javascript
const counter = Elaine.state(0);
const increaseCounter = () => {
    counter.value++;
};
```
As you can see here the `.value` of `counter` is changed which will trigger the update-link-cycle of the framework and update your DOM. 
This should work for most cases but sometimes (while working with arrays and objects) not all changes can be detected directly or you might want to trigger the update-link-cycle manually. You can do this by using the `notify` method on all states.

```javascript
const counter = Elaine.state({count:0});
const increaseCounter = () => {
    counter.value["count"] = counter.value["count"]++;
    counter.notify();
};
```

To declare a immutable state you simply don't use the `state` function and pass the state as a simple variable. Beware that theses state are immutable and changes to them will not trigger the update-link-cycle.
```javascript
const immutableState = "This will never change";
```

To declare a state which depends on other states you can call the `computed` function.
```javascript
const duration = Elaine.state(15 * 1000)
const elapsed = Elaine.state(0);
const progress = Elaine.computed(() => elapsed.value / duration.value, elapsed, duration);
```
These states are computed a given function, which you have to provide. You also have to list all the states this computed state depends on. In this example the computed state `progress` is computed by the function `() => elapsed.value / duration.value` and depends on the two states `elapsed` and `duration`.

### Template Syntax
To link states to DOM elements you have to use a special syntax within your DOM template. 
To link text content of text nodes you have to use the following syntax:
```html
<div>@@{counter}</div>
```

To link a state to an attribute you have to use @@ before the attributes name to indicate that it is a templated attribute and @@ within the template of the attribute value to reference your desired state.
```html
<div @@style="fontSize: @@fontSizeState">@@{counter}</div>
```
In this example `@@fontSizeState` would reference a state in JavaScript given to the `setup` function. 

To use conditional rendering you have to use the `@@if` attribute. Within the value if this attribute you can give the condition where you can also use states from you application to evalute the given condition which will also update if the given states change.
```html
<div @@if="@@counter > 10">Only show if counter > 10</div>
```

You can also use for loops to put an element multiple times into your DOM by giving it a state which contains an array. Given the following application
```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
Elaine.setup(document.getElementId("app"), {
    state: {
        fruits
    }
});
```
```html
<div id="app">
    <div @@for="fruit in @@fruits">@@{fruit}</div>
</div>
```
The `div` with the `@@for` attribute will render three times for each fruit in our `fruits` array. Within this for-loop you have access to the `fruit` variable which in this case is simply displayed within the `div` block. This would result in this DOM:
```html
<div id="app">
    <div>apples</div>
    <div>banana</div>
    <div>orange</div>
</div>
```
In loops you also have access to the current index of the array traversal. To use this index you have to use the `_index` keyword within your template.
```html
<div id="app">
    <div @@for="fruit in @@fruits">@@{_index}: @@{fruit}</div>
</div>
```
would result in:
```html
<div id="app">
    <div>0: apples</div>
    <div>1: banana</div>
    <div>2: orange</div>
</div>
```

If you have methods within your application you can also link them directly to DOM elements within your template by using the `++` symbols. You simply have to define an attribute with `++` following by the event name. For example for a click event you need to use `++click` and for a change event you need to use `++change`. 

```javascript
const counter = Elaine.state(0);
const increaseCounter = () => {
    counter.value++;
};
```
```html
    <div id="app">
        @@{counter}
        <button ++click="increaseCounter">Count</button>
    </div>
```
This for example will call the `increaseCounter` method each time the button is clicked.

If you are using it on an input field it might look like this:
```javascript
const text = Elaine.state("This is the default text.");
const setText = (e) => {
    text.value = e.target.value;
};
```
```html 
    @@{text}
    <input type="text" ++input="setText" @@value="@@text" />
```

This would update the `text` state whenever the input field fires the `input` event. Because these kind of bindings are very common there is a shortcut to bind `input` and `select` elements to given reactive states like this:
```javascript
const text = Elaine.state("This is the default text.");
```
```html 
    @@{text}
    <input type="text" @@model="text" />
```

### Custom Components
To reuse components within your application you can define components like this:

```html
    <div id="app">
        <counter></counter>
    </div>
```
```javascript
const counterComponent = Elaine.component({
    name: "counter",
    template: `
        <div class="counter">
            @@{counter}
            <button ++click="increaseCounter">Count</button>
        </div>
    `,
    setup: () => {
        const counter = Elaine.state(0);
        const increaseCounter = () => {
            counter.value++;
        };

        return {
            state: {
                counter, increaseCounter
            }
        }
    }
});


Elaine.setup(document.getElementById("app")!,
    {
        state: {},
        components: [counterComponent]
    }
);
```

By using the `component` function you can declare a component object which than can be passed to the `setup` function within an array with the field `components`. The component has to have a name by which it will be resolved within the DOM. It also has to have a template. The template can always only contain one HTML element.

There are also a few optional component properties which can be passed to the `component` function. 

```javascript
export type ComponentData = {
    name: string;
    template: string | Element;
    props?: Prop<any>[];
    slots?: string[];
    setup?: (state: InstanceState) => SetupState | void;
    onMounted?: (state: InstanceState) => void;
    beforeUnmounted?: (state: InstanceState) => void;
    onUnmounted?: (state: InstanceState) => void;
    beforeDestroyed?: (state: InstanceState) => void;
    onDestroyed?: (state: InstanceState) => void;
    css?: string | undefined;
};
```

#### Component Life-Cycle

Most of them are life-cycle functions which will be called in the life-cycle of the component. 

`setup` is called before the component ever enters the DOM. This function can return new states which will be linked to the components DOM.
`onMounted` will be called after the component was mounted to the parent DOM.
`beforeUnmounted` will be called before the component will be removed from the parent DOM (for whatever reason; this might als happen if the component element has a conditional rendering attribute `@@if`)
`onUnmounted` will be called after the component was removed from the parent DOM.
`beforeDestroyed` will be called before the component instance will be destroyed. A component instance will be destroyed if it is no longer used and will not be mounted to the DOM ever again.
`onDestroyed` will be called before the component instance was destroyed.

Within each of theses functions you have access to the internal component instance state at that given moment. The state looks like this:

```javascript
export type InstanceState = {
    element: Element,
    data: any,
    methods: any,
    refs: any,
    dispatchEvent: (eventName: string, payload: any | undefined) => void
};
```

With `element` you have access to the top-level element of your template within the DOM.
Within `data` you have access to all the declared states of the instance.
With `methods` you can access all the passed methods of the instance.
With `refs` you can access underlining child-component-instances which you annotated with the `ref="name"` attribute in your template. 
With `dispatchEvent` you can emit DOM events from your top-level template element which can be used to communicate back to the parent component.

This can be used to build a modal-dialog component like this:

```javascript
export default Elaine.component({
    name: "modal",
    template: `
    <div class="modal">
        <div class="modal-header">
            <div @@if="@@title != null" class="modal-title">@@{title}</div>
            <div ++click="close" class="modal-close">x</div>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
        </div>
    </div>
    `,
    setup: (state: InstanceState) => {
        const modal: Element = state.element;
        modal.setAttribute("style", "position: fixed; top: 10px; left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%); z-index: 1000;");

        const backdrop = document.createElement("div");
        backdrop.setAttribute("style", "position: fixed; left: 0; top: 0; z-index: 999; width: 100vw; height: 100vw; background-color: #80808095;");

        const close = () => {
            modal.parentNode?.removeChild(modal);
            if (backdrop.parentNode)
                backdrop.parentNode.removeChild(backdrop);
        };

        const open = () => {
            document.body.appendChild(backdrop);
            document.body.appendChild(modal);
        };

        backdrop.addEventListener("click", close);

        return {
            state: {
                close,
                open,
                backdrop
            }
        };
    },
    onMounted: (state: InstanceState) => {
        const modal = state.element;
        modal.parentNode?.removeChild(modal);
    }
});
```

#### Component Props

In a component you don't have direct access to the states of the parent instance. To pass states from the parent to a component instance you have to declare theses as props. As you can see in our modal example we need to pass the `title` from the parent to the modal component instance.
Props are declared within an array as objects which look like this: 

```javascript
export type Prop<T> = {
    name: string,
    required?: boolean,
    type: T,
    default?: T
}
```

To use them within your component add the `props` field to your component declaration. Afterwards you can access them within your life-cycle function within the `internalState.data` field or anywhere in the template.

```javascript
export default Elaine.component({
    name: "modal",
    template: `
    <div class="modal">
        <div class="modal-header">
            <div @@if="@@title != null" class="modal-title">@@{title}</div>
            <div ++click="close" class="modal-close">x</div>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
        </div>
    </div>
    `,
    props: [{
        name: "title",
        type: String
    }],
    setup: (state: InstanceState) => {
        const modal: Element = state.element;
        modal.setAttribute("style", "position: fixed; top: 10px; left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%); z-index: 1000;");

        const backdrop = document.createElement("div");
        backdrop.setAttribute("style", "position: fixed; left: 0; top: 0; z-index: 999; width: 100vw; height: 100vw; background-color: #80808095;");

        const close = () => {
            modal.parentNode?.removeChild(modal);
            if (backdrop.parentNode)
                backdrop.parentNode.removeChild(backdrop);
        };

        const open = () => {
            document.body.appendChild(backdrop);
            document.body.appendChild(modal);
        };

        backdrop.addEventListener("click", close);

        return {
            state: {
                close,
                open,
                backdrop
            }
        };
    },
    onMounted: (state: InstanceState) => {
        const modal = state.element;
        modal.parentNode?.removeChild(modal);
    }
});
```

Props can be passed from the parent by declaring an attribute on the element with the same name.
```html
<modal title="Add a new tab!"></modal>
```

#### Component Slots

Sometimes it is necessary to define template elements outside your component template. This can be achieved with slots. Slots are elements within your component which will be replaced by the defined elements in the parent component. To use slots you have to declare them within your component definition as a string array. To place them into your template simply use an element with the same name anywhere you like.

```javascript
export default Elaine.component({
    name: "modal",
    template: `
    <div class="modal">
        <div class="modal-header">
            <div @@if="@@title != null" class="modal-title">@@{title}</div>
            <header></header>
            <div ++click="close" class="modal-close">x</div>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
            <content></content>
        </div>
    </div>
    `,
    props: [{
        name: "title",
        type: String
    }],
    slots: ["content", "header"],
    setup: (state: InstanceState) => {
        const modal: Element = state.element;
        modal.setAttribute("style", "position: fixed; top: 10px; left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%); z-index: 1000;");

        const backdrop = document.createElement("div");
        backdrop.setAttribute("style", "position: fixed; left: 0; top: 0; z-index: 999; width: 100vw; height: 100vw; background-color: #80808095;");

        const close = () => {
            modal.parentNode?.removeChild(modal);
            if (backdrop.parentNode)
                backdrop.parentNode.removeChild(backdrop);
        };

        const open = () => {
            document.body.appendChild(backdrop);
            document.body.appendChild(modal);
        };

        backdrop.addEventListener("click", close);

        return {
            state: {
                close,
                open,
                backdrop
            }
        };
    },
    onMounted: (state: InstanceState) => {
        const modal = state.element;
        modal.parentNode?.removeChild(modal);
    }
});
```

On the parent side the template can be filled like this:
```html
<modal title="Add a new tab!">
      <header>
            I will be in the header!
      </header>  
      <content>
        <h2>@@{~title}</h2>
        <input @@model="@@todoTitle" type="text" placeholder="ToDo title" />
        <textarea @@model="@@todoContent" placeholder="ToDo content" rows="5"></textarea>
        <button ++click="addTodo" @@disabled="@@addTodoNotPossible">Add Todo</button>
      </content>
</modal>
```

### Component Slots with variants

It is also possible to have different variants of the same slot. To eplain the problem this sloves we have to use a different example. Imagine you want to write a table component like this:
```javascript
const table = ELAINE.component({
    name: "myTable",
    template: `
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th @@for="header in @@headers">
                    <div class="myTable-header">
                        <span>@@{header.label}</span>
                    </div>
               </th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr @@for="row in @@rows">
            <td @@for="header in @@headers">
                 <mycolumn variant="@@header.key"></mycolumn>
            </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    `,
    props: [
        {
            name: "items",
            type: Array
        },
        {
            name: "headers",
            type: Array
        }
    ],
    slots: ["mycolumn"]
});
```
The slot `mycolumn` has to be different depending on which column it is within the table. Of course it could be achieved by using `@@if` but instead you can also use slots with variants by declaring a `variant` attribute to your slot within your component template. This will be evaluated and chose the right slot when the component instance is setting up.

```html
    <myTable items="@@content" headers="@@headers">
            <mycolumn>
                <name>
                    @@{getFirstName(@@~data)} @@{~data.lastname}
                </name>
                <birthdate>@@{$dateTime(@@~data)}</birthdate>
                <default>
                    <div ++click="showData(@@~data, @@~constant)">@@{~data}</div>
                </default>
            </mycolumn>
    </myTable>
```
To declare multiple variants of a slot you simply declare nested elements with the variant name within your parent DOM.

All the states references within a slots are by default the states from the parent instance and not from the component instance. To use states from the component instance you can use the `~` before the state name. So `@@~data` would refer to the `data` state of the component instance while `@@data` would refer to the `data` state of the parent instance.

#### Component Events
Custom component events are binded like normal events. They can be emitted with dispatchEvent("event-name", "payload").
Beware that at the moment event names are always in lower-case.
